### Linked Lists
tasked to be able to instantiate a list, insert a node, include a node, and convert the node into strings.

#### Challenge
Create classes and node functions to be able to do all the mentioned things from above.

##### Approach and Efficiency
My approach is to go through the object and check for the nodes,
then move through and add a node to the next option,
then go through and see if a node exists,
then turn those values into strings
