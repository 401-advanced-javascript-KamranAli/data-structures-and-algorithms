### More Linked Lists
tasked to be able to add a node to the end, before a middle node or the first node, after a mid node or after the last node.

#### Challenge
Create classes and node functions to be able to do all the mentioned things from above.

##### Approach and Efficiency
My approach is to go through the the linked list and add node to the end,
move through the linked list and add a node before a mid index and the 1st node,
move through the linked list and add a node after a mid index and the last node.
