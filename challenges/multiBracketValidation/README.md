### Multi Bracket Validation
multiBracketValidation(String input)
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets.

#### Challenge
Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

##### Approach and Efficiency
My approach is to go through the object and check for string that return true,
any other versions of the strings should return false.
