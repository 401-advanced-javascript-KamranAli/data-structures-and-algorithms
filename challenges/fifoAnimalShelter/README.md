### Animal Shelter FIFO
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

#### Challenge
Create classes and node functions to be able to do all the mentioned things from above.

##### Approach and Efficiency
Basically just need to enqueue to the front of the queue and out, for both a cat and dog. EVerything else will be null
