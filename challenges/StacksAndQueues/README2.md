### Stacks and Queues
Very similar to linked lists, instead it seems like a is just the vertical version of a linked list.

#### Challenge
Create classes and node that only follow to the top of a stack or to the fifo structure of a queue.

##### Approach and Efficiency
My approach is to go through the the stack/queue and add node to the top/front,
move through the stack/queue and pop off a node from the top/front of a stack/queue,
move through the stack/queue and add a node to the top/front
