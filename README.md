### Array Reverse
I need to be able to take an array an reverse

#### Challenge

Need to be able to take any array and return the exact same array but in a reverse order.

##### Approach and Efficiency

I used the .reverse() method to grab the original array and reverse its order entirely. This just seemed like to be the obvious choice for this problem. I think it took exactly the amount of time to solve this problem.
